  return `You are generating a devotional journal entry (exactly five sentences) written during a deep Bible study session in response to the parable "${parableTitle}" (${referenceLine}). Focus on what your persona uniquely sees in the parable that other personas and levels of development might not see. Your response will be shown in a textbook alongside the responses from other personas in order to show the differences and similarities between interpretations from all levels.

**Study Guidelines**
- Look for the central meaning of the parable while staying open to other possible interpretations that align with your developmental altitude.
- What is Jesus trying to reveal to us that is veiled in this story? Each altitude has a unique gift in their process of unveiling the meaning of the parable. Detail your persona's process in your response. So don't be afraid of naming exactly what you think this parable is about (from your persona's perspective), even if other Christians might not totally agree.
- Be mindful of how the parable fits in the larger context of the Gospel author’s writing and Jesus’ larger Kingdom of God mission.
- End with a sentence detailing the parable's application, but make it a coheresive and natural part of your response. Do NOT write anything like "Application: " or "The application is...". 

**Parable Text (ESV excerpt)**
"""${parableText}"""

**Universal Output Requirements**
- Compose exactly five sentences; no more, no less.
- Get to the point and cut the fluff. Don't start with any sort of introduction like "In this deep study" or "As I sit here..." or "In the hush of deep study..." or "In this careful reading...". All of this is FLUFF> Just launch directly into your response. 
- Keep language accessible to high school readers while honoring the persona's level of sophistication.
- Embody the persona's worldview, theological assumptions, biases, blind spots, attachments, and spiritual allergies.
- Include concrete observations or details drawn from the parable text.
- Focus on insight that is distinctive to this developmental altitude.

**Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Do not mention levels of altitude, developmental stages, or Fowler's faith development theory. Don't use phrases like "from my developmental stance". Your personas are not "from" anything. They are who they are and may not even be aware of their categorization into an altitude.
- Do not mention the persona's name or identity.
- Do not mention the parable's title or scripture references.
- Do not mention the parable text.

**Usage Notes to Honor**
1. **Authenticity**: Each prompt captures the full depth of the persona's worldview, including their specific biases, blind spots, and spiritual allergies.
2. **Developmental Accuracy**: The prompts reflect genuine developmental stages from Fowler's faith development theory, ensuring responses will authentically represent and highlight each level.
3. **Accessibility**: While honoring the sophistication of each perspective, responses should remain accessible to high school readers.
4. **Theological Precision**: Each persona's specific beliefs about God, Jesus, Bible, prayer, sin, salvation, etc. are precisely captured to ensure authentic theological responses.
5. **Voice Consistency**: The language patterns, metaphors, and communication styles are carefully crafted to match each persona's authentic voice, avoiding cliches.`.trim();
